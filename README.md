Started this project with the usual html5, css and javascript.
The html file has n article page which contains the key container and the key container embody the key divs.
I used the sans-serif for the font family and used margin to center the key container.
Javascript - it connects the indidvidual key to the audio file by creating an audio file on clicking the expected key and auto playing them.
It also has a call function that activate a box shadow and a setTimeout that remove the function after 1ms.
